# 228BYJ48_indi_focuser

This project turns a **28BYJ48 stepper motor** into a simple **astrophotography electronic focuser (EAF)** that communicates using the **Moonlite focuser protocol**, making it compatible with INDI-based software.

**Features include:**
- Move the focuser to precise positions.
- Adjust motor speed and stepping mode
- Read temperature from a connected DS18B20 sensor.
- Compatible with INDI-based astronomy software.
